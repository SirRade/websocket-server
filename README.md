# websocket-server
boilerplate to effortlessly setup an asynchronous websocket server

This code was originally written for my game [Shootr](https://github.com/SirRade/shootr), but it is general enough to be in it's own crate. Keep in mind that it is designed primarely to be used by myself, so it's not documented that well. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions :)
